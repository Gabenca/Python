# Python laboranalysis web application
**This directory contains laboranalysis Python application which developed for deploying to server with full-fledged OS environment or Docker engined environment.**

## Ethical disclaimer
> In this application, we work with the portal and API of the headhunter.ru company. We are very grateful to headhunter.ru company for the beautiful portal and excellently-designed well-documented API, programming with which was a pure pleasure. We are aware of the complexity of the development and maintenance of such services and such a business as a whole. We are also fully aware that specialized databases are one of the main assets of the company. In connection with the foregoing, we should in no case forget that **this application was created exclusively for educational purposes and completely excludes the possibility of any business use.** Also remember that the company itself provides analytical reporting services that you can always use and this will be the best choice.

## Directory structure

* **deployment**
* **laboranalysis**

### deployment directory
